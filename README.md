# D3PIA: A Discrete Denoising Diffusion Model for Piano Accompaniment Generation

This is the official repository for our paper: **“D3PIA: A Discrete Denoising Diffusion Model for Piano Accompaniment Generation”** (submitted to ISMIR 2025).


We propose a discrete diffusion-based piano accompaniment generation model, **D3PIA**, leveraging the locally aligned structure of musical accompaniments with the lead sheet in the piano roll representation. Our model incorporates Neighborhood Attention (NA) to both encode the lead sheet and condition it for predicting note states in the piano accompaniment, which enhances local contextual modeling by efficiently attending to nearby melody and chord conditions. 

## Note
We noticed that our final paper submission inadvertently omitted the number of participants in the subjective evaluation. **A total of 18 participants took part in the listening test.** We apologize for the oversight and any confusion it may have caused.
