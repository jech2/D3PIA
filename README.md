# D3PIA: A Discrete Denoising Diffusion Model for Piano Accompaniment Generation

We propose a discrete diffusion-based piano accompaniment generation model, **D3PIA**, leveraging the locally aligned structure of musical accompaniments with the lead sheet in the piano roll representation. Our model incorporates Neighborhood Attention (NA) to both encode the lead sheet and condition it for predicting note states in the piano accompaniment, which enhances local contextual modeling by efficiently attending to nearby melody and chord conditions.
